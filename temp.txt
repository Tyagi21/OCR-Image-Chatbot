Aviation includes the activities surrounding mechanical flight and the aircraft
industry. Aircraft include fixed-wing and rotary-wing types, morphable wings,
wing-less lifting bodies, as well as lighter-than-air aircraft such as hot air balloons

and airships.

Aviation began in the 18th century with the development of the hot air balloon, an
apparatus capable of atmospheric displacement through buoyancy. Clément Ader
built the "Ader Eole" in France and made an uncontrolled, powered hop in 1890.

This was the first powered aircraft, although it did not achieve controlled flight.

Some of the most significant advancements in aviation technology
came with the controlled gliding flying of Otto Lilienthal in 1896. A major
leap followed with the construction of the Wright Flyer, the first
powered airplane by the Wright brothers in the early 1900s.

Since that time, aviation has been technologically revolutionized by the
introduction of the jet engine which enabled aviation to become a major
form of transport throughout the world. In 2024, there were 9.5 billion
passengers worldwide according to the ICAO|!"] As of 2018. estimates
